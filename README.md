# Teaching Cybersecurity

Welcome to my teaching repository! This repo is used to organize lesson plans, student examples, and my reflections while teaching beginner cybersecurity analysts.

## Repository Structure

- **lesson-plans/**  
  Contains detailed plans for each week or session. Each file should describe the topic, objectives, and exercises.

- **student-examples/**  
  Sample files or templates for students to reference. This can include Markdown files, screenshots, or example commands.

- **teaching-notes.md**  
  Personal notes on each session: what worked, what didn’t, and improvements for future classes.

## How This Repo Is Used

1. Prepare your lesson in `lesson-plans/` before each class.  
2. Add example files for students in `student-examples/`.  
3. After class, add reflections to `teaching-notes.md`.  

## Goals

- Maintain organized teaching materials.  
- Provide a reference for students.  
- Track improvements in teaching over time.
